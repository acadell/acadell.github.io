                <dd>Look around, as classes end at ASU, NPCs at ASU Polytechnic may need help! Assist these NPCs in moving out of their dorms or houses to earn in game loot! NPCs may require help parting with poor equiptment, meeting up with strangers to trade old loot for ($) dollars, moving old and heavy equiptment to a dumpster (we know, nobody likes escort mission.) Test your skills with the new inventory management system where you stack large items into a medium vehicle. There is lots to discover outside this week. You just need to explore! </dd>
